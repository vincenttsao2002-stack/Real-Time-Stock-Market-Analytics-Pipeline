## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end real-time data pipeline** using the **Modern Data Stack**.  
We capture **live stock market data** from an external API, stream it in real time, orchestrate transformations, and deliver analytics-ready insights — all in one unified project.



## ⚡ Tech Stack
* **Snowflake** → Cloud Data Warehouse
* **DBT** → SQL-based Transformations
* **Apache Airflow** → Workflow Orchestration
* **Apache Kafka** → Real-time Streaming
* **Python** → Data Fetching & API Integration
* **Docker** → Containerization
* **Power BI** → Data Visualization

---

## ✅ Key Features
* Fetching **live stock market data** (not simulated) from an API
* Real-time streaming pipeline with **Kafka**
* Orchestrated ETL workflow using **Airflow**
* Transformations using **DBT** inside Snowflake
* Scalable cloud warehouse powered by **Snowflake**
* Analytics-ready **Power BI dashboards**

🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repo and set up the environment.

Start Kafka + Airflow services via Docker.

Run the Python producer to fetch live stock data.

Data flows into Snowflake → DBT applies transformations.

Orchestrate everything with Airflow.

Connect Power BI for visualization.

⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Kafka Setup
Configured Apache Kafka locally using Docker.

Created a stocks-topic to handle live stock market events.

Defined producers (API fetch) and consumers (pipeline ingestion).

2. Live Market Data Producer
Developed Python producer script stock_producer.py to fetch real-time stock prices from the Finnhub API using an API key.

Streams stock data into Kafka in JSON format.

Producer Code

3. Kafka Consumer → MinIO
Built Python consumer script stock_consumer.py to consume streaming data from Kafka.

Stored consumed data into MinIO buckets (S3-compatible storage).

Organized storage into folders for raw/bronze layer ingestion.

Consumer Code

4. Airflow Orchestration
Initialized Apache Airflow in Docker.

Created DAG (stock_pipeline_dag.py) to:

Load data from MinIO into Snowflake staging tables (Bronze).

Schedule automated runs every 1 minute.

Airflow DAGs

5. Snowflake Warehouse Setup
Created Snowflake database, schema, and warehouse.

Defined staging tables for Bronze → Silver → Gold layers.

SQL scripts available at:

Snowflake Setup

6. DBT Transformations
Configured DBT project with Snowflake connection.

Models include:

Bronze models → raw structured data

Silver models → cleaned, validated data

Gold models → analytical views (Candlestick, KPI, Tree Map)

7. Power BI Dashboard
Connected Power BI to Snowflake (Gold layer) using Direct Query.

Built:

Candlestick chart → stock market patterns

Tree chart → stock price trends

Gauge charts → stock volume & total sales breakdown

KPIs → real-time sortable view

📊 Final Deliverables
Automated real-time data pipeline

Snowflake tables (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

Transformed analytics models with DBT

Orchestrated DAGs in Airflow

Power BI dashboard with live insights
